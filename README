---Minecraft Miner---

--About--

Well this little program developed out of my curiosity of Python, 
my wonder over the wonderful module Beautiful Soup, and finally my
 love of minecraft. I used to play minecraft with my brother on a 
local server and often we would "give" stuff to ourselves. This 
turned out to be a chore and using macros was limited to a couple
 of block types. Hence the creation of Minecraft Scraper.

--Usage--

Type in the name of the block type and the id will come up.

For Example: 

 python MinecraftMiner.py bow

Will Show:

261 : bow

Some searches return more than one result:

$ python MinecraftMiner.py sword
283 : Sword Gold
268 : Sword Wooden
267 : Iron Sword
272 : Sword Stone
276 : Diamond Sword

Currently the only options to filter the result are:

-w (default) : Match whole words
-c : Return all the items which contain the strings passed
-m : Find the closest match by comparing the length of the search and the result

The last feature is to return the ids by themselves using the argument "-o"

python MinecraftMiner.py -o iron sword
267

Oh and I forgot to tell you that the way the program finds the
 ids is by searching the official minecraft wiki. It searches 
through the html tables and creates a local file to speed up
 the next searches. To force the script to use the site use 
the "-u" argument.

--Disclaimer--
No license on this I don't really care. It's kinda late here and 
I'm writting this readme in Emacs so expect many formatting, 
grammatical, and spelling errors.

Oh and it also happens to be the first time I'm using git/github.
